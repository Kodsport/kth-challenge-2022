Ingrid is the founder and CEO of bicycle retailer BIKEA. The company sells bicycles 
for customers to assemble themselves.

BIKEA has $N$ different bicycles to offer. Ingrid wants to give each of them 
a human-readable name, to make it easy to remember. But doing this by hand is 
a very time consuming task. 

You are given the number $N$, and your task is to generate $N$ different names.
To make the names readable, they must satisfy the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each name has length between $3$ and $20$, and only consists of lowercase 
English letters.
\item Three consecutive letters of a name cannot all be vowels or consonants. 
Here we consider \texttt{a}, \texttt{e}, \texttt{i}, \texttt{o}, \texttt{u} vowels, while the remaining
$21$ letters are consonants.
\end{enumerate}

For example, \texttt{hello}, \texttt{abc}, and \texttt{lkab} are all valid names, whereas \texttt{ingrid}, 
\texttt{bo} and \texttt{louise} are invalid. 

\section*{Input}
The input consists of one integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 30000$), the number of names to generate.

\section*{Output}
Print $N$ lines, each of them containing a name. It can be proven that it is possible to generate
 $N$ different names.
